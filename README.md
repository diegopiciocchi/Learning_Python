# Learning Python
A collection of projects for learning the basics of Python programming for scientific purposes. Here follows a list of the projects and possible future developement.

## Pendulum simulation

1. Simulation of the motion of a simple pendulum with viscous damping and visualisation in a short animation. 
2. Simulation of a double pendulum and relative animation.

### Future...

A triple pendulum simulation might be interesting!

## "Millikan" experiment simulation

The aim of this project is the simulation and visualisation of the motion of particles inside a box and subject to the graviational force and electrostatic force.
